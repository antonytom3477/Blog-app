Project Description
The Blog App is a simple web application built using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. This application allows users to create, view, edit, and delete blog posts. The primary goal is to demonstrate a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality in a web application without persistent storage. Therefore, posts will not persist between sessions.
